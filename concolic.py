"""
This file implements a concolic execution engine. It assumes that
a program under test is instrumented and will use the API
concolic.guard() to collect path constraints, and the API
concolic.set() and concolic.set() to manipulate a symbolic store.

The main algorithm in this file is from the DART paper:
	Patrice Godefroid, Nils Klarlund, and Koushik Sen. 2005.
	DART: Directed Automated Random Testing. In Proceedings of
	the 2005 ACM SIGPLAN conference on Programming Language
	Design and Implementation (PLDI '05).
	DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/1065010.1065036

The entry point to the engine is concolic.run().
